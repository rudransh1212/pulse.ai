# Pulse.ai

Pulse.ai is an AI-driven system that predicts early software
instability before bugs, crashes, or outages occur.

The system monitors three independent health signals:

1. Code Pulse – risk introduced by code evolution
2. Runtime Pulse – drift in system behavior
3. Bug Pulse – probability of future bug emergence

These signals are fused into a single Pulse Score that
represents the overall health of a software system.
